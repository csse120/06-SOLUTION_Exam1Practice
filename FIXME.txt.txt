STATUS of these FIXMEs:
  — Problem 2a become problem 2, as recommended.
  — Problem 2 (the original one) needs a home, as recommended below.
  — I don’t know whether problem 2 (the original one) has had the fixes recommended below.
  — The paper and pencil problems have been updated, but they still need another look.

FIXMEs:
The problem2a picture needs to become a simple video,
like the problem2b_SampleRuns, since problem 2a has animation.

problem2b_SampleRuns is good but has small details
that are no longer accurate.

The paper and pencil problems removed questions on:
  -- 2 and 3 argument range expressions
  -- input/output
Make sure those get BACK into Test 2 practice.

The last problem on the paper and pencil problems (on vocabulary about objects) remains troubling, in that:
  -- we know an object when we see one (?), but I am unsure that question is accurate.
  -- We need to distinguish  math.sin(...)   from circle.attach_to(...), but I am unsure that the words METHOD and FUNCTION accomplish that.  I think most people would say that a method is a particular kind of function.
  -- Likewise, variable and object -- not sure we are doing that right.
  
More generally, the paper and pencil problems need an update throughout.

 Problem 2 alt needs to get folded in (we did not use it this term)
 and the problems re-numbered throughout.  I think that the right
 approach may be:
   1. Do problem0 in Live Coding (15 minutes) and leave it numbered 0.
   2. Problem2_alt becomes problem2.
   3. Problem2 either goes away or (better?) gets done earlier
      in the term (so that get_mouse has been done).
   4. Problem3 stays as is, but with test cases given for part A.
